      <h2>Michele’s Wellness Story</h2>
      <img src="./images/cropped_picture_of_michelle.png" alt="The owner of Soulful Serenity Wellness" />

      <p>
        Hello and welcome to Soulful Serenity Wellness! I’m Michele, and I’m so glad you’re here! My personal health
        journey began over 20 years ago when I set out to overcome a challenging auto-immune diagnosis using a variety
        of holistic methods. Along the way, I also faced career burnout, which became a pivotal turning point for me. It
        inspired me to discover a deeper purpose and reignite my passion for helping others find balance and joy in
        their lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as a certified Energy Healer and Sound Therapy Practitioner (and soon-to-be Compassion Key practitioner!),
        I’m dedicated to guiding you toward a healthier, more harmonious connection between your mind, body, and soul.
        Whether you're looking to release energy blockages, work through suppressed emotions, or simply need a moment to
        reset, I’m here to support your journey every step of the way. Let’s embark on this path to transformation
        together!

        <h2>How Helping People Has Changed Me</h2>
        <p>Every step of my journey as a healer has been nothing short of life-changing. Working with clients has taught
          me more than I ever imagined about empathy, compassion, and the incredible impact of true human connection.
          Each session is a unique experience, and I am continually inspired by the amazing transformations I witness.
        </p>

        <p>Through energy work and sound therapy, I've had the privilege of helping others release blockages and
          rediscover inner peace. It's been deeply fulfilling—not only because I see the positive changes in those I
          work with but because it has enhanced my own understanding of the mind-body-soul connection. Every person I
          help deepens my own growth, teaching me to be present, to listen closely, and to truly celebrate every moment
          of healing.</p>

        <p>What keeps me inspired is the profound shifts I get to witness—whether it's a moment of clarity, an aha
          moment, or a breakthrough in healing. These experiences fuel my passion and remind me of the immense power we
          all have to heal and grow. I feel so honored to support each individual on their journey, and I'm constantly
          motivated by their strength and resilience.</p>

        <p>If you're ready to experience your own transformation, I’d love to be part of your healing journey. Let’s
          work together to create lasting change and well-being—one step at a time!</p>

I had been feeling for years that my heart chakra was completely blocked and so I asked Michele if we could work on this area. During the session, I felt a lot of sensation in my chest area as well as in my arms and hands. But what I think was the most powerful was some of the messages Michele relayed to me from my spirit guides. They were SPOT ON exactly what I needed to hear. Since the session, I have made leaps and bounds in healing and transforming the narratives I have around love, men, and relationships. Thank you so much Michele for being a part of my journey!!
